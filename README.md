Nori is a free and open source Android client for tag-based image archives and galleries. Work is currently underway to make a version that does not violate the Google Play Store [Developer Content Policy](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/).

If you're interested in contributing to Nori, have any questions or just want to hang out, join us in the `#nori` IRC channel on Freenode.

### Build ###

To build Nori, first make sure you have cloned the repository recursively to also get a copy of [norilib](https://github.com/tjg1/norilib), our API client library:

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/tjg1/nori
```

Providing you have the Java JDK and Android SDK installed on your computer, you should now be able to use the Gradle wrapper to build Nori:

```bash
$ cd nori
$ ./gradlew build
```

You can also use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to build Nori.
